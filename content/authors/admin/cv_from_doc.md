Career
Reha-Technology Internship (3 weeks)							2016
My main tasks at a medical engineering and robotics company included the: 
verification of bill of materials based on 3D models
creation of 2D drawings and its dimensioning
communication with supplier
incoming goods inspection
assembly of prototypes and creation of assembly documentation.
Geier GmbH Internship (1 month)							2017
As an intern at a crawler type vehicle company, I was involved in the:
postprocessing of manufacturing parts
assembly of gearboxes, machine elements, and wire harnesses
creation of 3D CAD models using Autodesk Inventor
mechanical calculation of machine elements
introduction to SPS programming using Codesys.
TU Graz Racing Team Formula Student (2 years)					2017 – 2019
As the Data Acquisition subgroup leader, I gained experience through the:
development of a quasi-steady state lap time simulation using Matlab
parametrization of a tire model
further development of a dynamic vehicle model in Simulink
development of a tool to analyze vehicle test data
planning, preparation, and documentation of on track vehicle testing days.
Porsche Motorsport Internship (6 months)						2019 – 2020
My tasks at the Performance Formula E department included the contribution and support to the:
development of a software tool with a GUI to find the lap time optimized energy distribution
development of a method to automatically identify the parameters of a thermal battery model
implementation of a tool to analyze and visualize the road roughness of track models
implementation of various software tools, among others a graphical user interface to read data from the team data base and a tool to automatically generate HTML reports
operations of the motorsport driving simulator as well as the maintenance and modification of track models.
TU Wien Student Assistant (1 semester)						2021	
As a student assistant for the institute of Mechanics and Mechatronics E325, I:
supervised projects done by groups of students in the course 325.041 Continuous Simulation.
Siemens Mobility Working Student (1 year)						2021 – 2022
As a working student at the department of engineering metro interiors, I worked on the:
creation of 3D models and 2D drawings of metro interior parts using PTC Creo
maintenance of requirements list
revision and refactoring of mechanical calculation documentation for e.g., adhesive bonding or impact tests using Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and PTC Mathcad.
Siemens Mobility Diploma Thesis							2022
I am currently working on my master diploma thesis at the department of strength calculation about numerical investigations on welding distortion. These investigations consist of the deployment of a thermo-elasto-plastic finite element simulation by using Altair Hyperworks and FabWeld as pre-processors, LS-Dyna as a solver, and Altair Hyperview as well as custom python scripts as post-processing tools.
